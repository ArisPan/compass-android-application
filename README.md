# Project Compass Android Application

## A few words on Project Compass
Compass is a location monitoring platform with GPS reading optimisation capabilities.
Its development is part of the March-April 2021 Software Development internship in [Terracom SA](www.terracom.gr).

## Android Application Description
The role of this application is to provide end users with an intuitive interface which allows them to log their routes.
The app is receiving GPS coordinates at a given time interval. They are then passed to a FaaS implementation of the Kalman filter in order to improve accuracy.
The user interface will provide an overview of the user current route with the help of Google Maps API.

## Setup
In order to preview and develop the application, we 'll be using Android Studio.
To load the project, start by going to `File -> New -> Project from Version Control`. The *Get from Version Control* window pops up. Make sure to log in to your GitHub account from the *GitHub* tab. Then, in the *Repository URL* tab, select Git for Version control. Paste the repository URL and specify the directory in which the project will reside. Finally hit *Clone*.<br>
*Note that Android Studio projects, usually reside in* `C:/Users/username/AndroidStudioProjects/`.<br>

In order to get the google API to work you have to include the key in your *local.properties* file.
Since this is a local configuration file generated by Android Studio, you will have to manually add the line `google.map.key = <KEY>` in its contents.
