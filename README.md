# Project Compass Android Application

## A few words on Project Compass
Compass is a location monitoring platform with GPS reading optimisation capabilities.
Its development is part of the March-April 2021 Software Development internship in [Terracom SA](www.terracom.gr).

## Android Application Description
The role of this application is to provide end users with an intuitive interface which allows them to log their routes.
The app is receiving GPS coordinates at a given time interval which in turn are filtered using the Kalman Algorithm in order to improve accuracy.
The user interface will provide an overview of the user current route with the help of Google Maps API.

## Setup
In order to preview and develop the application, Android Studio will be used.
To load the project, start by cloning the repository in your local machine. Open Android Studio then go to Files -> Open, navigate to the project direcotry and hit OK.<br>
*Note that Android Studio projects, usually reside in* `C:/Users/username/AndroidStudioProjects/`.<br>

In order to get the google API to work you have to include the key in your *local.properties* file.
Since this is a local configuration file generated by Android Studio, you will have to manually add the line `google.map.key = <KEY>` in its contents.
